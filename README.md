# SYSINFO
SYSINFO.exe is a piece of software that allows you to see your system properties as well as test your Internet connection by pinging 14 servers! 
You can also see useful information about your hard disks. 

(If you have Unigine's Heaven Benchmark installed, you can also start it from this software. You just need to specify the file path and file name after SYSINFO pings the servers. 
Pinging the servers might take up to 2 minutes depending on your connection speed! If some servers (6, 13) fail to connect or respond, it is ok as they are probably not accepting 
ping requests or are undergoing maintainance at the time of running the ping command. Servers 6 and 13 have had the least success with the ping test!)

NOTE: THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH NO WARRANTY! ANY DAMAGE THAT YOU DO USING THIS SOFTWARE (THis appens rarely, if at all) IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!
